    The application allows you to track attendance
        dance classes (salsa direction).
        
    "Students" - add/edit/delete
    
    "Attendance" - shows the dates on which classes took place or will take place
     for the selected month. Default is current.
     Gray color of the date - the subscription is no longer valid.
     Blue color of the date - the subscription is valid and can be edited by touching:
        red - student missed class
        green color - the student was engaged
        white - unchecked.

    "New" - get a new subscription for a student. 
    Classes are held on Tuesday and Friday.
